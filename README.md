# A Simple Timer Telegram Bot

# How to use existing bot

I am a simple timer bot. 

Usage:

Enter /<minutes> [label] to create a new timer. Give the number of minutes till the timer runs out with an optional label.
However, you can create multiple timers using the same command and have them running simultaneously.

For eg., /10 walk will create a timer for 10 minutes with label walk.
